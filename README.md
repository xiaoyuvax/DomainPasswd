# DomainPasswd
[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/q1m0e7xqilyv0969?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Tewr/domainpasswd)

Winform & Command-line utility for changing the password of a user on a domain. 

In current fork, a form is added in favor of user friendliness.

In original author's current corporate environment, all other ways I've tried for changing the password of a domain user **other than the one currently logged on** has failed (except for doing it directly while logged on to the domain controller itself). Also, works well with KeePass autotype.
